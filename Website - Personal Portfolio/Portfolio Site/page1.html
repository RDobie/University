<p>My Role enabled me to put my qualifications into practise as i was one of a few designated first aiders aswell as enjoying the opportunity to interact with children with various disabilities and help and support them to be able to have access to play and be able to integrate and play with other children.
 outside of volunteering i have been involved in many charities both through school and outside of school which included collecting money for charities such as <a href="http://www.jeansforgenesday.org/" target="_blank">jeans for Genes</a>,<a href="http://www.tenovus.org.uk/" target="_blank">Tenovus</a>,<a href="http://www.mariecurie.org.uk/" target="_blank">Marie Curie</a>,<a href="http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6115947/k.8D6E/Official_Site.htm" target="_blank">Save the Children</a> and selling poppies for the <a href="http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/" target="_blank">Royal British Legion</a></p>
